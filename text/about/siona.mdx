**Data Science premajor, Tea and Carnivorous Plant Enthusiast**

Data-Science premajor passionate about coding, tea (especially sencha!), and carnivorous plants.

I first began coding ten years ago, mainly utilizing C++ up until 2019. At which point I then began learning web development and branched out to other languages such as Ruby, Javascript, Python, and more.

Other things I do besides coding are: studying japanese, baking sourdough, tending to my plants, taking care of my dog, reading manga in either english or japanese (slowly), and enjoying multiple cups of tea.

Favorite Programming Language: Ruby
