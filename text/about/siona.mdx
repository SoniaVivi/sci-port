**Web Developer, Tea and Carnivorous Plant Enthusiast**

Web developer passionate about coding, tea (especially sencha!), and carnivorous plants.

Mainly focused on front-end development, but have made multiple projects utilizing Ruby on Rails and have made a self-designed Python SQL query interface.

I first began coding ten years ago, mainly utilizing C++ up until 2019. At which point I then began learning web development and branched out to other languages such as Ruby, Javascript, Python, and more.

Other things I do besides coding are: studying japanese, baking sourdough, tending to my plants, taking care of my dog, reading manga in either english or japanese (slowly), and enjoying multiple cups of tea.

Favorite Programming Language: Ruby
