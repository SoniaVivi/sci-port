**Data Science premajor, Tea and Carnivorous Plant Enthusiast**

Data-Science premajor passionate about coding, tea (especially sencha!), and carnivorous plants.

I first started coding in 2011 with an initial interested in game development. Later on in 2019 I decided to take a gap year after highschool. During this time I developed an interest in web development so I chose to self-study web development.

A few months later the Covid-19 pandemic started and the gap year turned into multiple. Early on I chose to continue improving my skills on coding and web development. During the break I familized myself with a wide range of languages, such as Ruby, Typescript, and SQL.

Additionally, while improving my skills with SQL and building an ORM I realized that I enjoyed working with data. Not solely with SQL, however. Rather, I became increasingly interested in using that data to gain insights. That interest eventually led to me deciding to pursue Data Science.

Other things I do besides coding and studying are: studying japanese, biking, hiking, tending to my plants, taking care of my dog, reading manga in either english or japanese, and enjoying multiple cups of tea.

Favorite Programming Language: Ruby
Favorite Tea: Sencha
