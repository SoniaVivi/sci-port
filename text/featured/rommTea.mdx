# Romm Tea

**A Tea Journaling Website For Tea Enthusiasts**

Created with: Ruby on Rails, React, styled-components

**Introduction**

In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic I discovered the beauty of tea. Exploring the various teas out there I eventually settled on Japanese green tea. Sencha, Gyokuro, Matcha. To aid in my exploration I decided to create a site to keep track of the most important aspects of hot leaf water infusing.

From there, Romm Tea was created.
