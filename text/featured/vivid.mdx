# Vivid Image Organizer

**Built For Handling Large Quantities Of Images Effectively**

Created with: Python, SQL

Born while working night shifts at my first job, Vivid is the first real giant project I tackled on. Designed solely by me without referring to other existing image organizers and minimal use of frameworks and libraries.

The backend that handles all the image logic is completely self-designed and the frontend is built using Kivy, a GUI framework.

The database interface can be reused in other projects that require it and supports add-ons.

Features:

- A fully self-designed database interface

- Capable of handling over 20 thousand images. My personal copy has slightly less than that as of 22/4/23.

- A command line interface

- Supports searching by name, tag, and image hash

- Blacklisting images and directories

- Opening images in a program of your choice

- Mass tagging and deleting

- Fully documented database interface

**Use the dev-version-2 branch version for the greatest and latest features!**
