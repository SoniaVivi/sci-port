# Miko Reader

**A Manga Reader Web Application**

Created with: React, Redux, styled-components

API's: Mangadex, AniList

**Introduction**

The year was 2021, the manga reading site Mangadex went down due to technical issues. The site was completely unavailable for months. Initially, only an API was released. For many months more there was not an official site. In August of that year, I decided to make my own while integrating the AniList API in it as a stopgap fix.

**Overview**

Miko Reader is a manga reading web app that integrates various AniList features into a users manga reading experience with minimal disruptions.

Utilizes the Mangadex API to fetch, search, and display manga.

Utilizes the AniList API to display mangas in the users manga lists (completed, reading, planned, and dropped) and updating a manga's reading status, personal rating, and chapter progress when reading or previewing.
