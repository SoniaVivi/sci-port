# Plastic, Microplastics, And Their Effects

A mainstay in cyberpunk works is the technological improvement of the human body using cybernetic implants. How does this relate to plastic? Simple. Plastic naturally release tiny fragments called “microplastics” that causes change in the human body. These are in a way cybernetic implants that alter your body’s natural system. Read on to learn about these super cool body enhancing particles!

    To this day, there have been no hard conclusive evidence about these tiny cybernetic enhancements and their effects on the human body. According to a study published by the peer reviewed journal Ambio, they found that some microplastics fibers, “...will go on to cause inflammatory response and even respiratory lesions...”(Blackburn & Green, p.522).

As we can see, these particles are potentially greatly capable of altering your body in a technological way! While the effects can be stated by buzz-killers as “bad” for you, having malfunctioning cybernetics enhancements is a common staple in cyberpunk. Additionally, have you ever thought about just how risky living in general is? Every day car accidents happen on the roads and there frequently is one party who wasn’t at fault. Embrace the risk of plastic! Just like a cyberpunk main character would!

    Have you paid attention to the skyline of cyberpunk works? They are frequently filled with smoke, smog, and all other kinds of pollutants. Having microplastics be all around helps with the immersion that we truly are living in a cyberpunk world. While we may not have the very cool flying cars, indistinguishable robotic androids, or holograms floating around we getting closer and closer every year. From our microplastics, endless enthralling entertainment available where ever we go, and our increasingly technological world we are on a fast track to living in a true cyberpunk world!

    If you wish to learn more on how prominent plastic is in the medical field, read on! I recently talked with a person who works in a medical clinic in our dear city of Bellingham. Talking with her I learned that almost all instruments and supplies are packaged in our much beloved plastic or are heat sterilized in plastic. We can see here that even in the most sensitive places that we regularly visit we can never escape the grasp of plastic. Just like the endless secret police that permeates every sector in a cyberpunk society.

    If you wish to make your life more fantastical in a highly realistic way, I highly recommend embracing these cybernetic implants that we already have available to us. Consume the particles, talk with our highly intelligent and capable chatbots, and use technology that our predecessors couldn’t even conceptualize.
