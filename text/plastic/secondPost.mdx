# Lets Maximize!

If you had read the very wordy above (I don’t blame you if you didn’t) you’ll know exactly why we should all embrace the maximum consumption of microplastics. Luckily for us, microplastics are everywhere we look. Whether it be the plastic lining of aluminum cans (yes, it’s there too!), synthetic fabrics forming your clothes, or everyday disposables it’s easy to get our very own cybernetic implants!

    One route of transmission of microplastics is in the very air that we breathe in everyday. Everyday, tires from cars shed many tiny particles of microplastics that can travel long distances. From an article published by Forbes written by a physicist, “...the average tire could lose 4kg [of weight] during its lifetime…”(Winkless, pp.3). As tires are made of plastic this weight loss contributes microplastics to our everyday environment. Walking by a road allows us to reach our daily wanted value of microplastics! In our efforts in embracing these modern day cybernetic implants we should both drive and be in close proximity to these deliverers of microplastics.

    While the tires would, probably, remain on the pavement some distance away from others generally we don’t have to be that close to ingest these microplastics. In a study published by Springer nature, they found that microplastics can easily travel for, “...a distance of less than 100 km...”(Enyoh et al, p.668). As we can see, even if we travel out in the wilderness we still cannot escape these particles. While we could theoretically travel to Antarctica to escape, does the common person have the resources to be capable of that? Besides, a large percentage of clothing itself is formed of plastic!

    Another way we could potentially increase our microplastics intake is by using containers or utensils that are made out of plastic. For an example, if we were to give our very young family members plastic baby bottles we would help maximize their consumption starting from a very young age. As was reported on by the news organization The Guardian, they found that many baby bottles give off millions of particles of microplastics a day(Carrington, pp.3). While adults don’t use such bottles we could still take this report to heart. We should continue, if not increase, our consumption of beverages in containers that are composed of plastic. By regularly utilizing these containers we are telling reality that we embrace the risk of causing all sorts of health effects that range from “bad” to “worse”. Just like the average person in a cyberpunk society!
