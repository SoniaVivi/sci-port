# SVivn's Personal Website and Portfolio

<a href="https://svivn.herokuapp.com">Link to the website</a>

Made with Next.js and Typescript. Contains information pertaining to myself and my personal projects that I've made over the years, ranging from web applications to browser extensions to a GUI image organizer desktop app.

Design is inspired by the cyberpunk genre, futuristic media, synthwave, outrun, the game VA-11 HALL-A, and my preference for minimalism.
